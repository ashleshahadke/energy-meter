# energy-meter
A system that records your daily consumption and gives you a prediction for upcoming monthly bill ,
give total consumed till date and an option for prepaying the bill using Arduino Uno.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a prepaid programmable energy 
meter system that integrates components such as an energy meter, GSM module, 
Arduino Uno microcontroller, relay, switch, and load. The system aims to provide users 
with real-time monitoring and control of their energy consumption, facilitated by a 
prepaid billing mechanism. Through the implementation of a load control mechanism 
and a user-friendly interface, the project seeks to empower users to actively manage 
and optimize their energy usage. The overarching goal is to promote energy 
conservation while ensuring the security of user data and providing comprehensive 
documentation for future reference and maintenance. The project will conclude with a 
thorough evaluation of the system's performance, identifying areas for optimization to 
enhance overall functionality and reliability
